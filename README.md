  <h1>New York City's Motor Vehicle Collisions with Person Analysis</h1>
</p>
- In urban areas, traffic accidents stand as a leading cause of injury and fatality, involving collisions between pedestrians, motor vehicles, and other road users like cyclists. 

- Three primary impact types occur: those on the vehicle, the occupant's state, and the organs within the occupant's body. Moreover, each collision incorporates essential elements such as ejection occurrences, complaints, incident time, and date. 

- Analyzing these aspects post-collision aids in uncovering the reasons behind the accident, enabling the prevention of future incidentsâ€”an integral part of the accident investigation process.

We extracted information from **NYC | OpenData**, a repository of free public data provided by various New York City agencies and partners. The dataset, sourced from a 2021 collision in New York involving a person and a motor vehicle, excludes incidents with injuries or deaths costing less than $1,000. The data includes details such as the date and time of the occurrence, the injury location, and the police description.
